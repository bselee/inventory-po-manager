# TypeScript Fixes Summary

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Updated tsconfig.json
- Changed target from "es5" to "es2015" to support Map/Set iterations
- Added "downlevelIteration": true
- Updated lib to include "esnext"

### 2. ✅ Fixed Missing Type Exports
- Exported `FinaleApiConfig` interface from `app/lib/finale-api.ts`
- Exported `SyncOptions` interface from `app/lib/finale-api-optimized.ts`

### 3. ✅ Fixed Private Property Access
- Changed private properties to protected in `FinaleApiService` class:
  - `config`, `baseUrl`, `authHeader` are now protected

### 4. ✅ Fixed JWT Type Mismatch
- Updated `verifyToken` method in `app/lib/auth.ts` to properly cast jose JWT payload to our JWTPayload type

### 5. ✅ Fixed Error Type Handling
- Updated error catches to check `instanceof Error` before accessing `.message`
- Example: `e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)`

## Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)

These issues don't prevent the build but should be addressed:

1. **Settings Type Mismatch** in `useSettings.ts`
   - The default settings object is missing some optional properties
   - Solution: Import and use the proper Settings type from consolidated.ts

2. **Inventory Types** 
   - Some inconsistencies between different inventory type definitions
   - Solution: Consolidate all inventory types into one source of truth

3. **Implicit Any Types**
   - Several handlers have implicit any types in catch blocks
   - Solution: Add proper error type annotations

4. **Re-export Issues**
   - Some modules re-exporting types without using `export type`
   - Solution: Use `export type` for type-only exports

## To Run Tests

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Start dev server (fixes static asset issues)
npm run dev

# Run Playwright tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Build Status

The application should now:
- ✅ Compile without blocking errors
- ✅ Serve static assets correctly when dev server is running
- ✅ Have all critical type exports available
- ✅ Handle errors with proper type safety

The TypeScript fixes are complete enough for development and testing to proceed.
