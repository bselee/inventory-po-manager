# Fix Test Issues Without Redis

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Ensure Dev Server is Running
```bash
# In one terminal:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Server is Responding
```bash
# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### 3. Run Settings Tests in Debug Mode
```bash
# See what's actually happening:
npm run test:e2e:debug -- tests/e2e/settings/settings-buttons.spec.ts
```

### 4. Check for UI Changes
The tests are looking for specific elements. Let's verify they exist:
- Check if buttons have the expected `data-testid` attributes
- Verify the settings page loads correctly at http://localhost:3000/settings

## Why You Don't Need Redis

1. **Performance is Fine Without It**
   - For most use cases, the Finale API rate limiting (2 req/sec) is the bottleneck, not database queries
   - Supabase is plenty fast for inventory lookups

2. **Complexity Not Worth It**
   - Redis adds another service to manage
   - Another potential failure point
   - More configuration in production

3. **Current Design Works Well**
   - The app gracefully handles missing Redis
   - No functionality is lost without it

## If You Really Want Redis Later

For production optimization, you could add Redis for:
- Caching expensive Finale API calls
- Reducing load on Supabase
- Improving response times for frequently accessed data

But it's definitely not needed to get your tests passing or for normal operation.

## Immediate Action Items

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Check that http://localhost:3000/settings loads
3. Run a simpler test first: `npm run test:health`
4. If tests still fail, check the HTML structure matches test expectations
