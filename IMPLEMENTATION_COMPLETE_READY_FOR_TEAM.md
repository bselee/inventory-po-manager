## 🔧 INTEGRATION GUIDE

### Add to Admin/Settings Page
```tsx
import EnhancedSyncManager from '@/app/components/EnhancedSyncManager'

export default function AdminPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
      <EnhancedSyncManager />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Use Real-time Features in Inventory Components
```tsx
import { useInventoryRealtime, useCriticalAlerts } from '@/app/hooks/useInventoryRealtime'

export default function InventoryDashboard() {
  const { inventory, isLoading } = useInventoryRealtime()
  const { alerts, markAsRead } = useCriticalAlerts()
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your inventory UI with real-time updates */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Execute Enhanced Sync Programmatically
```typescript
import { executeEnhancedSync } from '@/app/lib/enhanced-sync-service'

// Execute smart sync with all optimizations
const result = await executeEnhancedSync({
  strategy: 'smart',
  enableChangeDetection: true,
  enableRealTimeMonitoring: true
})

console.log(`Processed ${result.itemsProcessed} items`)
console.log(`Efficiency gain: ${result.changeDetectionStats.efficiencyGain}%`)
```
