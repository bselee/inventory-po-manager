# üö® ACTION REQUIRED: Finale API Setup

## You're Almost There! Just Need API Credentials

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Application is running with cached data (100+ inventory items)
- Settings page is fixed and ready
- All infrastructure is in place

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- Finale REST API credentials to sync fresh data
- The Report URLs have expired and won't work

## üìã Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your API Credentials (2 minutes)

1. **Open Finale in your browser:**
   ```
   https://app.finaleinventory.com/buildasoilorganics
   ```

2. **Navigate to API Settings:**
   - Click `Settings` (gear icon)
   - Go to `Integrations`
   - Click `API Access`

3. **Generate API Credentials:**
   - Click `Generate New API Credentials` button
   - Copy the `API Key` 
   - Copy the `API Secret`

### Step 2: Add Credentials to Your App

1. **Open the file:** `.env.local`

2. **Find these lines (at the bottom):**
   ```
   FINALE_API_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY
   FINALE_API_SECRET=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_SECRET
   ```

3. **Replace with your actual credentials:**
   ```
   FINALE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   FINALE_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret_here
   ```

4. **Save the file**

### Step 3: Test & Sync

1. **The app will auto-reload** (you'll see "Reload env: .env.local" in terminal)

2. **Go to Settings page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/settings
   ```

3. **Click `Test Connection`** - Should show "‚úÖ Connection successful!"

4. **Click `Manual Sync`** - This will fetch all your current Finale data

5. **Check your inventory:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/inventory
   ```

## üéØ That's It!

Once you add those two credentials, everything will work:
- Real-time inventory data
- Vendor information
- Purchase order generation
- Automatic syncing

## üì± Quick Links

- **Finale API Settings:** https://app.finaleinventory.com/buildasoilorganics/settings/integrations
- **Your App Settings:** http://localhost:3000/settings
- **Test Data Page:** http://localhost:3000/test-data
- **Inventory Page:** http://localhost:3000/inventory

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If connection fails:
1. Make sure you copied the ENTIRE API key and secret (they're long!)
2. Check there are no extra spaces or quotes
3. The app should auto-reload when you save .env.local
4. Try refreshing the settings page

## üìù Note
The Report URLs in your .env.local have expired - that's why sync wasn't working. The REST API is much more reliable and won't expire.
