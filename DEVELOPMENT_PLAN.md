# Fix Sync Errors & Feature Development Plan

## Immediate Issues to Fix

### 1. JSON Parsing Error - HIGH PRIORITY
**Issue**: `Unexpected token 'A', "An error o"... is not valid JSON`
**Root Cause**: Finale API is returning error messages as plain text, but the code tries to parse them as JSON
**Solution**: Implement robust error handling with text/JSON detection

### 2. TypeScript Compilation Errors - HIGH PRIORITY  
**Issues**: Multiple compilation errors in finale-api.ts
- Map iteration without downlevelIteration
- Missing property types on FinaleProduct interface
- Duplicate code sections

## Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (Week 1)

### Fix Sync Errors
- [ ] Implement safe JSON parsing with fallback to text
- [ ] Add proper error handling for Finale API responses
- [ ] Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Add better logging for debugging sync issues
- [ ] Test with actual Finale API responses

### Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] Create standardized error response format
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- [ ] Add error notification system

## Phase 2: Authentication System (Week 2-3)

### User Management
- [ ] Install and configure NextAuth.js or Supabase Auth
- [ ] Create user registration/login pages
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Viewer)
- [ ] Add user profile management

### Access Control
- [ ] Protect all API routes with authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement permission checks for sensitive operations
- [ ] Add audit logging for user actions
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for user management

## Phase 3: Unit Testing Infrastructure (Week 3-4)

### Jest Setup Enhancement
- [ ] Configure Jest with proper TypeScript support
- [ ] Create test utilities and mocks
- [ ] Add test database setup/teardown
- [ ] Implement API endpoint testing

### Business Logic Tests
- [ ] Test inventory calculations (cost, quantities, reorder points)
- [ ] Test purchase order logic
- [ ] Test sync algorithms and data transformations
- [ ] Test forecasting calculations
- [ ] Add edge case and error condition tests

### Coverage Goals
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ code coverage for critical business logic
- [ ] Set up automated coverage reporting
- [ ] Integrate coverage checks into CI/CD pipeline

## Phase 4: Forecasting View (Week 4-5)

### Data Analysis
- [ ] Implement velocity calculation algorithms
- [ ] Create seasonal trend analysis
- [ ] Build demand forecasting models
- [ ] Add inventory turnover metrics

### Forecasting UI
- [ ] Design forecasting dashboard
- [ ] Add interactive charts and graphs
- [ ] Implement date range filtering
- [ ] Create forecast export functionality

### Predictive Models
- [ ] Simple moving average forecasting
- [ ] Exponential smoothing
- [ ] Seasonal decomposition
- [ ] Machine learning integration (optional)

## Phase 5: Webhook Integration (Week 5-6)

### Webhook Infrastructure
- [ ] Create webhook endpoint for Finale updates
- [ ] Implement webhook authentication/validation
- [ ] Add webhook event processing queue
- [ ] Create webhook retry mechanism

### Real-time Sync
- [ ] Replace polling with event-driven updates
- [ ] Implement real-time inventory notifications
- [ ] Add websocket support for live updates
- [ ] Create webhook monitoring dashboard

## Phase 6: Export Capabilities (Week 6-7)

### Excel Export System
- [ ] Implement Excel file generation
- [ ] Create customizable report templates
- [ ] Add scheduled report generation
- [ ] Implement email delivery of reports

### Report Types
- [ ] Monthly inventory summary
- [ ] Purchase order reports
- [ ] Vendor performance reports
- [ ] Financial summary reports
- [ ] Custom report builder

### Export Features
- [ ] Multiple format support (Excel, CSV, PDF)
- [ ] Automated month-end reports
- [ ] Report scheduling and delivery
- [ ] Historical data exports

## Implementation Strategy

### Agentic Development Approach
1. **Self-Testing**: Each phase includes automated tests
2. **Self-Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and monitoring
3. **Self-Healing**: Error recovery and retry mechanisms
4. **Self-Optimizing**: Performance monitoring and optimization

### Quality Gates
- All code must pass TypeScript compilation
- 80%+ test coverage for new features
- All E2E tests must pass
- Security scan must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be met

### Risk Mitigation
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Database migrations with rollback capability
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Backup and restore procedures

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Zero critical bugs in production
- < 2 second page load times
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero security vulnerabilities

### Business Metrics
- Reduced manual inventory errors by 80%
- Faster month-end reporting (from days to hours)
- Improved inventory turnover tracking
- Real-time visibility into stock levels

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | Week 1 | Fixed sync errors, stable system |
| 2 | Week 2-3 | Authentication, access control |
| 3 | Week 3-4 | Comprehensive test suite |
