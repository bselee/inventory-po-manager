# Finale Data Mapping Analysis

## Current Situation

The Finale API is returning product catalog data but **NOT inventory quantities**. Here's what we found:

### Available Finale Data (from /product endpoint):
- `productId` - Product identifier (e.g., "BC101")
- `internalName` - Product name/description
- `productTypeId` - Type of product (e.g., "GOOD")
- `statusId` - Active/Inactive status
- `priceList` - Array of prices by type
- `supplierList` - Empty in test data
- `reorderGuidelineList` - Empty in test data
- `lastUpdatedDate` - Last modification date

### Missing Critical Inventory Data:
❌ `quantityOnHand` - Current stock level
❌ `quantityAvailable` - Available to sell
❌ `quantityAllocated` - Reserved for orders
❌ `reorderPoint` - When to reorder
❌ `reorderQuantity` - How much to order
❌ `cost` - Product cost
❌ `location` - Where it's stored

## What This Means

The current sync implementation expects these fields but they're not being returned by Finale. This is why the sync appears to work but no useful inventory data is being stored.

## Required for Inventory Management

For a functional inventory system, we need:

### 1. **Stock Levels** (Critical)
- Current quantity on hand
- Available quantity (on hand - allocated)
- Allocated/committed quantity

### 2. **Reorder Management**
- Reorder point (when to order)
- Reorder quantity (how much to order)
- Lead time from suppliers

### 3. **Purchase Order Creation**
- Items below reorder point
- Suggested order quantities
- Preferred vendors
- Item costs

### 4. **Out of Stock Reporting**
- Items with zero quantity
- Items below safety stock
- Items with pending orders

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Find the Right Finale Endpoint
The facility/inventory endpoint returns "undefined". We need to:
- Check Finale documentation for the correct inventory endpoint
- Contact Finale support for API guidance
- Try authenticated session-based endpoints

### Option 2: Use Finale's Web Interface Data
- Some systems provide different data via web vs API
- May need to use a different authentication method
- Could require screen scraping or export/import

### Option 3: Manual Data Entry
- Use Finale for product catalog only
- Manually maintain stock levels in your system
- Less ideal but ensures you have the data you need

### Option 4: Different Integration Method
- Finale may offer CSV exports with inventory data
- Webhook notifications for inventory changes
- Direct database access (if available)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Contact Finale Support** - Ask specifically:
   - "How do we get quantityOnHand via the API?"
   - "Is inventory data available through a different endpoint?"
   - "Do we need additional API permissions?"

2. **Check Finale Admin Panel** - Look for:
   - API permissions/scopes
   - Inventory module activation
   - Data export options

3. **Test Alternative Approaches**:
   - Try exporting inventory data as CSV
   - Check if web interface shows the data
   - Look for batch/report endpoints

Without actual inventory quantities, the system cannot:
- Track stock levels
- Generate reorder suggestions
- Show out-of-stock items
- Create meaningful purchase orders

This is the core issue that needs to be resolved.
