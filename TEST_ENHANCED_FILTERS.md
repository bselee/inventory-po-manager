1. **Out of Stock** (Red) - Zero inventory items
2. **Reorder Needed** (Orange) - Items flagged for reordering  
3. **Dead Stock** (Gray) - Slow-moving excess inventory
4. **Overstocked** (Purple) - Items with too much stock
5. **Fast Moving** (Green) - High-velocity items
6. **Low Value** (Blue) - Items under $50
7. **Critical Stock** (Red) - Urgent low stock situations
8. **BuildASoil Products** (Emerald) - Your manufactured items ⭐
9. **Supplier Materials** (Indigo) - External vendor items needing reorder ⭐
10. **High Value Items** (Yellow) - Items over $100 ⭐

#### **Advanced Capabilities:**
- **💾 Save Custom Filters** - Create and save personalized filter combinations

- **🔍 Enhanced Filter Logic** - Sales velocity, stock days, value ranges
- **💿 localStorage Persistence** - Your settings are automatically saved
- **🎨 Visual Enhancement** - Color-coded filters with icons

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Basic Filter Testing**
1. Navigate to `/inventory` page
2. Look for the "Filter System" toggle in top-left (should show "✨ Enhanced")
3. Verify you see the enhanced filter panel with color-coded filter buttons
4. Click different filters and verify:
   - Filter counts appear on each button
   - Items are filtered correctly
   - Active filter is highlighted

### **Step 2: Saved Filters Testing**
1. Click the "+" button to create a custom filter
2. Configure filter parameters in the modal
3. Save the filter with a custom name
4. Verify the saved filter appears in the filter list
5. Test that saved filters persist after page refresh

### **Step 3: System Toggle Testing**
1. Click the filter system toggle to switch to "📊 Legacy"
2. Verify the original filter panel appears
3. Switch back to "✨ Enhanced"
4. Verify enhanced filters are still working

### **Step 4: BuildASoil-Specific Testing**
Test the business-specific filters:
1. **BuildASoil Products** - Should show manufactured items
2. **Supplier Materials** - Should show external vendor items
3. **Fast Moving + Low Stock** - Should help identify manufacturing priorities

## 🎯 **Expected Benefits**

### **For Daily Operations:**
- **Faster filtering** with visual filter buttons

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Enhanced Filters Don't Appear:**
1. Check that toggle shows "✨ Enhanced"
2. Refresh the page
3. Check browser console for errors

### **If Filter Counts Are Wrong:**
1. Verify inventory data is loaded
2. Check that items have the required fields (stock, sales_velocity, etc.)
3. Test with a smaller filter first

### **If Saved Filters Don't Persist:**
1. Check localStorage is enabled in browser
2. Verify you're using the same domain/port
3. Clear localStorage and try again: `localStorage.clear()`
