## 🚀 **How to Enable Saved Filters (Step 3)**

### **Option A: Quick Integration (Recommended)**
Replace your current filter panel with enhanced quick filters by updating `inventory/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add to imports
import { EnhancedQuickFilters } from '@/app/components/inventory/EnhancedQuickFilters'
import { useEnhancedInventoryFiltering } from '@/app/hooks/useEnhancedInventoryFiltering'

// Replace existing filter logic with:
const {
  filteredItems,
  filterCounts,
  activeFilter,
  applyFilter,
  clearFilters
} = useEnhancedInventoryFiltering(allItems)

// Replace filter panel JSX with:
<EnhancedQuickFilters
  activeFilter={activeFilter}
  onFilterChange={applyFilter}
  onClearFilters={clearFilters}
  itemCounts={filterCounts}
  className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6"
/>
```

### **Option B: Gradual Migration**
Keep your current system and add saved filter capability:

1. **Add Save Filter Button to Current Panel**
2. **Use localStorage for persistence**
3. **Add Custom Filter Creation Modal**
