# MVP Feature Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Planning

### Executive Summary
Implementation of 4 critical MVP features for inventory-po-manager to achieve operational excellence within 30-day sprint timeline.

### Feature Analysis

#### 1. Functional Email Alert System (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Current State:**
- EmailAlertService exists but has issues:
  - Missing proper error handling for `logError` function
  - No retry mechanism for failed emails
  - Limited template customization
  - No batch alerting for efficiency

**Requirements:**
- Fix undefined `logError` function
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add email template system with branding
- Create batch processing for multiple alerts
- Add email preference management in settings
- Implement daily digest for critical items

**User Stories:**
- As an inventory manager, I need daily alerts for critical stock items so I can prevent stockouts
- As a system admin, I need sync failure notifications to maintain system health
- As a business owner, I need customizable alert thresholds for different product categories

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 90%+ email delivery success rate
- Alerts sent within 5 minutes of trigger event
- Support for HTML email templates with company branding
- Configurable alert frequency (immediate, hourly, daily digest)
- Email preference management UI in settings

#### 2. Manual PO Generation Tool (Priority: HIGH)
**Current State:**
- Basic PO page exists with mock data
- API endpoints present but incomplete
- No actual PO creation functionality
- Missing vendor grouping logic

**Requirements:**
- Identify items needing reorder (current_stock ≤ minimum_stock)
- Calculate reorder quantities using sales velocity
- Group items by vendor for efficient ordering
- Generate draft POs with line items
- Simple approval workflow

**User Stories:**
- As a purchasing manager, I need to quickly generate POs for items below reorder point
- As an approver, I need to review and approve POs before sending to vendors
- As a vendor manager, I need POs grouped by vendor to streamline ordering

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automatically identify all items needing reorder
- Calculate optimal reorder quantities based on 30-day sales velocity
- Group items by vendor with subtotals
- Generate POs in less than 3 seconds
- Support approval/rejection workflow

#### 3. Enhanced PO Management (Priority: HIGH)
**Current State:**
- PO display uses Finale report data
- Limited editing capabilities
- No PDF export functionality
- Basic status tracking only

**Requirements:**
- Display real PO data from Finale/database
- Add comprehensive status tracking
- Enable PO editing (quantities, prices, notes)
- Export to PDF for vendor communication
- Track PO lifecycle (draft → approved → sent → delivered)

**User Stories:**
- As a purchasing manager, I need to edit PO details before sending
- As a vendor coordinator, I need PDF exports to send to suppliers
- As an operations manager, I need to track PO status through delivery

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Display all PO data accurately from source
- Support 5 status states (draft, approved, sent, partial, delivered)
- Allow editing of quantities, prices, and notes
- Generate PDF within 2 seconds
- Track status changes with timestamps

#### 4. Basic Reporting Dashboard (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current State:**
- No dedicated dashboard
- Metrics scattered across pages
- No consolidated view of critical data

**Requirements:**
- Key inventory metrics display
- Items requiring immediate attention
- Recent PO summary
- Sync status overview
- Visual charts for quick insights

**User Stories:**
- As an operations manager, I need a dashboard showing critical metrics at a glance
- As an inventory manager, I need to see items requiring immediate attention
- As a business owner, I need visual insights into inventory health

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Display 5 key metrics (total SKUs, critical items, pending POs, sync status, inventory value)
- Show top 10 items needing attention
- Display last 5 POs with status
- Real-time sync status indicator
- Load dashboard in under 2 seconds

### Technical Dependencies

1. **Database Schema Updates:**
   - Add email_preferences table
   - Add po_approvals table
   - Add dashboard_metrics table
   - Update purchase_orders table with lifecycle fields

2. **External Services:**
   - SendGrid API (existing, needs fixes)
   - Finale Reporting API (working)
   - Redis cache (operational)
   - PDF generation library (new requirement)

3. **Infrastructure:**
   - Background job processing for email digests
   - Scheduled tasks for alert generation
   - Cache warming for dashboard metrics

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| SendGrid rate limits | High | Medium | Implement batching and queue system |
| Finale API changes | High | Low | Add API response validation |
| PDF generation performance | Medium | Medium | Use worker threads or serverless function |
| Email delivery failures | High | Medium | Add retry logic and fallback notifications |
| Dashboard query performance | Medium | High | Implement Redis caching strategy |
