# Deploy Command

Force a fresh Vercel deployment when automatic deployments aren't working.

## Usage
```
/deploy [token]
```

## What it does

1. **Checks Git Status**
   - Ensures all commits are pushed to GitHub
   - Warns about uncommitted changes

2. **Verifies Configuration**
   - Checks vercel.json exists
   - Warns about cron jobs that might block Hobby plan deployments

3. **Forces Fresh Deployment**
   - Uses `vercel --prod` to deploy directly
   - Bypasses any webhook or cache issues

4. **Verifies Success**
   - Checks the health endpoint
   - Shows deployment URLs

## Common Issues Fixed

- **Stuck on old commit**: Forces fresh build from latest code
- **Webhook disconnected**: Deploys without relying on GitHub webhook
- **Cron job blocking**: Warns if cron schedule incompatible with Hobby plan
- **Cache issues**: Forces new build instead of redeploying cached version

## Example Output
