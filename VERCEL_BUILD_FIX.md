# Vercel Build Fix

To fix the react-hot-toast build issue on Vercel:

1. **Locked react-hot-toast version**: Changed from `^2.5.2` to `2.4.1` for stability
2. **Added SimpleToast fallback**: Created backup toast component in case of issues
3. **Clear Vercel cache**: Force fresh dependency installation

## Build Commands
```bash
# Clear npm cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Test build locally
npm run build
```

## Vercel Deployment
The fixed package.json should resolve the module resolution issue on Vercel's build environment.

If issues persist, the SimpleToast component in `app/components/common/SimpleToast.tsx` can be used as a drop-in replacement for react-hot-toast.
