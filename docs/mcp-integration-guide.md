- "Configure a Cloudflare Worker to cache JSON responses. use context7"
- "Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions with TypeScript. use context7"
- "Show me how to use React Hook Form with validation. use context7"

## VS Code Configuration

The MCP servers are configured in `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "serena": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from", 
        "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena", 
        "serena-mcp-server",
        "--project", 
        ".",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "cwd": ".",
      "env": {}
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "./context7/dist/index.js",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "cwd": ".",
      "env": {}
    }
  },
  "mcp.enabled": true
}
```

## Practical Use Cases for Our Inventory System

### 1. Code Analysis with Serena
- **Inventory Component Optimization**: Analyze React components in `/app/inventory/` for performance improvements
- **API Route Enhancement**: Review and optimize Next.js API routes for better error handling
- **Database Query Optimization**: Suggest improvements to Supabase queries
- **TypeScript Type Safety**: Identify potential type issues and suggest better type definitions

### 2. Documentation and Examples with Context7
- **Supabase Integration**: "Show me best practices for Supabase real-time subscriptions in Next.js. use context7"
- **Playwright Testing**: "Create comprehensive E2E tests for inventory filtering. use context7"
- **Next.js API Routes**: "Implement proper error handling in Next.js API routes. use context7"
- **React State Management**: "Show me how to optimize React state for large lists. use context7"

## Integration Benefits

### Enhanced Development Workflow
1. **Intelligent Code Analysis**: Serena provides deep semantic understanding of our codebase
2. **Up-to-date Documentation**: Context7 ensures we're using current best practices
3. **Automated Refactoring**: Serena suggests code improvements automatically
4. **Framework Guidance**: Context7 provides specific guidance for Next.js, React, and Supabase

### Specific to Our Project
- **Inventory Management**: Optimize filtering and sorting algorithms
- **Purchase Order Logic**: Enhance business logic with better patterns
- **API Integration**: Improve Finale API integration with best practices
- **Testing Strategy**: Create comprehensive test suites with current testing patterns

## Usage Instructions

### For Serena (Automatic)
Simply work with your code in VS Code. Serena will:
- Provide intelligent suggestions
- Analyze code semantically
- Suggest refactoring opportunities
- Help navigate complex code relationships

### For Context7 (On-demand)
Add "use context7" to your prompts when you need:
- Current documentation for libraries
- Code examples and patterns
- Integration guidance
- Best practices for specific frameworks

## Examples in Action

### Example 1: Optimizing Inventory Filter Performance
**Prompt**: "Analyze the inventory filtering function for performance issues and suggest improvements"
**Expected**: Serena will analyze the `getFilteredAndSortedItems()` function and suggest optimizations

### Example 2: Implementing Real-time Updates
**Prompt**: "Show me how to implement real-time inventory updates using Supabase subscriptions. use context7"
**Expected**: Context7 will provide current documentation and examples for Supabase real-time features

### Example 3: Enhanced Error Handling
**Prompt**: "Review the API error handling patterns and suggest improvements"
**Expected**: Serena will analyze current error patterns and suggest better approaches

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test Serena
uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena-mcp-server --help

# Test Context7
node ./context7/dist/index.js --help

# Build Context7 (if needed)
cd context7 && npm install && npm run build
```

## Next Steps

1. **Enable MCP in VS Code**: Ensure MCP extension is installed and configured
2. **Test Integration**: Try the example prompts above
3. **Customize Configuration**: Adjust server settings as needed
