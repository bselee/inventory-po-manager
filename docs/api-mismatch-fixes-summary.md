# API Method Mismatch Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed the method mismatch where the frontend was using PATCH methods but the API only implemented PUT methods for inventory updates.

## Files Modified

### 1. Stock Update Endpoint
**File**: `/app/api/inventory/[id]/stock/route.ts`
**Change**: Added `export const PATCH = PUT` to support both PUT and PATCH methods
**Status**: ✅ Completed

### 2. Cost Update Endpoint
**File**: `/app/api/inventory/[id]/cost/route.ts`
**Change**: Added `export const PATCH = PUT` to support both PUT and PATCH methods
**Status**: ✅ Completed

### 3. Visibility Update Endpoint
**File**: `/app/api/inventory/[id]/visibility/route.ts`
**Change**: 
- Created the entire route file (was empty)
- Implemented both PUT and PATCH methods
- Added support for updating item visibility (hidden field)
**Status**: ✅ Completed

### 4. Data Access Layer
**File**: `/app/lib/data-access.ts`
**Changes**:
- Added `updateInventoryVisibility` function
- Added support for 'hidden' field in `updateInventoryItem` function
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## API Endpoints Summary

All endpoints now support both PUT and PATCH methods:

```typescript
// Stock Update
PUT/PATCH /api/inventory/{id}/stock
Body: { stock: number }

// Cost Update  
PUT/PATCH /api/inventory/{id}/cost
Body: { cost: number }

// Visibility Update
PUT/PATCH /api/inventory/{id}/visibility
Body: { hidden: boolean }
```

## Testing

A test script has been created at `/test-api-methods.js` to verify all endpoints work correctly with both methods.

To run the tests:
1. Ensure the development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Run the test script: `node test-api-methods.js`

## Frontend Compatibility

The frontend code in `/app/inventory/page.tsx` uses PATCH methods for all three operations:
- `handleStockUpdate` - Uses PATCH ✅
- `handleCostUpdate` - Uses PATCH ✅
- `handleToggleItemVisibility` - Uses PATCH ✅

All API endpoints now support these PATCH requests, ensuring full compatibility.

## Database Schema Note

The implementation assumes the `inventory_items` table has a `hidden` boolean column for visibility control. If this column doesn't exist, it needs to be added to the database schema.
