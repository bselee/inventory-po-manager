# Vercel Exports Update Summary

## Overview
Added required Vercel runtime configuration exports to all API route files to fix deployment issues.

## Changes Made
Added the following exports to all route.ts files in the app/api directory:

```typescript
export const runtime = 'nodejs'
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
export const maxDuration = 60
```

## What These Exports Do
- `runtime = 'nodejs'`: Explicitly sets the runtime to Node.js (required for Next.js 14 API routes on Vercel)
- `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`: Forces dynamic rendering, disabling static optimization for API routes
- `maxDuration = 60`: Sets the maximum execution time to 60 seconds (Vercel's maximum for Pro plans)

## Files Updated
Successfully updated 67 route files across the following directories:
- `/app/api/` (root level routes)
- `/app/api/cron/` (scheduled tasks)
- `/app/api/sync-finale/` (Finale sync endpoints)
- `/app/api/purchase-orders/` (purchase order management)
- `/app/api/vendors/` (vendor management)
- `/app/api/settings/` (settings management)
- Various test and debug endpoints

## Notes
- Some files already had partial exports (only `dynamic`) and were updated to include all three
- The exports were added after import statements for consistency
- All API routes now have proper Vercel configuration for deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel using `npm run deploy`
2. Monitor deployment logs for any remaining issues
3. Consider removing test/debug endpoints from production if not needed
